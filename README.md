The information given to us for the analysis was insufficent to give Steve's parents the confidence needed to invest their life's savings into DQ.  We need additional information on the company such as a five-to-ten-year analysis on the performance of the stock (or if they are a startup, as many years as available.) It would also be helpful to review their 10q, and complete an anyalysis on the profits of the company in comparison to the stock performance.

## Summary

Based on the 2017 data, the assumption is that DQ would be a good investment.  Then in looking at 2018 the stock would not be a sound investment.  It is recommended that Steve not have his parents invest his inheritence in DQ without further investigation into the company and other green energy solutions.  They should take their time to fully analyze and understand the market.
